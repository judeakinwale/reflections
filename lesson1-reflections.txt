version control is important.
version control software being used is git.
note that a commit is a snapshot of a repository
common git commands:
	git log
	- shows a list of all the commits, with details about the commits including comments 
	git diff "old commit's id" "new commit's id"
	- compares two commits, highlighting the differences. this is very useful for finding and fixing mistakes and differences in the code that could cause bugs
	git checkout "commit's id"
	- this replaces the latest commit with another commit using it's id. it is very useful for figuring out what build introduced bugs by testing older builds using their commits

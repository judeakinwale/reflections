some more common git commands:

	git init
	- initializes a git repository in a given folder

	git status
	- gives information on the status of the git repository

	git add filename
	- adds a file to the repository
	note: when a file is changed (editted), it needs to be added again. #this is known as staging

	git diff
	- shows the difference(s) between the files in the staging area and the files in the working directory

	git diff --staged
	- shows the difference between the file/files in the staging area and those in the most recent commit

	git reset --hard
	- gets rid of all the changes in the staging area and working directory. be careful when using this, making sure you know what is 
          in the staging area and working directory and making sure they are not needed as this is not reversible

	git branch
	- shows a list of all branches

	git branch branchname
	- creates a branch with the name, branchname
	
	git commit
	- this commits the files in the staging area. it also opens a set code editor to write in a commit message.

	git commit -am "commitmessage"
	or
	git commit -m "commitmessage"
	- this commits files with commitmessage being the commit message

	git rm --cached filename
	- removes a file in the staging area

	git log --graph --oneline branchname1 branchname2
	- shows the order of the branches and where they divergeq

	*the concept of reachability
	- git log starts with the current commit or any commit specified in a branch (or  any branch specified) and traces it back till it gets to a commit which has no parent. This is generally the initial commit.
	- a commit is reachable from another commit if they are connected by a parent child connection
	
	git merge master branchname
	- this merges the brannch branchname to the master branch. ensure that you're in the master branch (checkout the master branch) before running this command

	git show commitid
	- shows the difference between the commit with the id, commitid and its parent commit
	- after merging, the commits are arranged using time from the most recent to the oldest. sometimes, the commit directly behind another commit may not be it's parent. you dont have to know the id of the parent commit

	git branch -d branchname
	- deletes the branch, branchname
	- if branchname has been merged with master, the commits from branchname are also under master, so branchname is safe to delete

	git checkout -b branchname
	- this saves the files in the staging area to a new branch with a name, branchname

	git merge branch1 branch2
	- this merges two branches together.
	- the other branch is merged into the working directory branch. to merge the master branch into anothe branch, for example, experimental, run:
		git checkout experimental
		git merge master experimental

	*merge conflict resolution 
	- when there is a conflict, the affected parts of the file are highlighted in the code, with indicators for the different versions of the same section highlighted. to resolve the conflict, the unwanted versions are deleted as well as the indicators (put there by git) leaving the correct section and making modifications where needed
